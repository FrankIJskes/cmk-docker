Host to be checked:
Copy the (bash) files in cmk-docker/host/plugins/ to the host in the directory: /usr/local/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/ (or change to your specified plugins directory)

Mods to check_mk_server:
Copy the (python) files in cmk-docker/cmk-server/checks/ to your check_mk server in directory /opt/omd/versions/1.30/share/check_mk/checks/

Maybe you'll need to give a : cmk -R to reload the new python scripts.
